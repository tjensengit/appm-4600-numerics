## Course Information
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Estimated Workload
This is intended to have a high workload, similar to Calculus III (which is 4 credits) and more than an elective class

## Prereqs
APPM 3310 (matrix methods).  Minimum grades of C-.

We used to require MATH 3430 or APPM 2360 (these are ODE and linear algebra courses), so it's not a bad idea to have these courses...

## Textbook
[Burden and Faires' textbook](https://sites.google.com/site/numericalanalysis1burden/) (9th or 10th edition) is our primary book, but homework problems will be written out explicitly, so it is not 100% necessary to purchase the book. This course has used this book in recent years, and it is used by the second semester class.

There are many other reasonable textbooks that can be used as a supplement.  For example,
- [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation, by Driscoll and Braun, SIAM](https://fncbook.github.io/fnc/frontmatter.html) from 2017. The first part of the book is free online, and they have examples in Matlab, Python and Julia (all good modern languages).
- [Numerical Analysis, 1e, L. Ridgeway Scott, $95](https://app.perusall.com/catalog/9781400838967), which integrates with Perusall
- [Scientific Computing: an Introductory survey, by Michael T. Heath](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~heath/scicomp/notes/). This has been used before (around 2018) for this class.
- [Numerical Mathematics, by Quarteroni, Sacco & Saleri, 2007](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781475773941) which is free on CU via SpringerLink. This is quite detailed and used for graduate courses sometimes
- [Numerical Anaysis, by Tim Sauer](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Analysis-3rd-Timothy-Sauer/dp/013469645X). This is used by CSCI-3656 some semesters.
- [Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms, by Anne Greenbaum and Tim P. Chartier, 2012](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691151229/numerical-methods), also integrates with Perusall. Focuses on a few topics.

Other good ideas are at the [CSCI-3656 class](https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-class/blob/master/Syllabus.md#Resources); in particlar, [Eijkhout (2017), Introduction to High-Performance Scientific Computing](http://pages.tacc.utexas.edu/~eijkhout/istc/istc.html) is much more high-performance implementation oriented.

## Syllabus
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md) and the detailed [day-by-day schedule](schedule.md)

## Recitations/Labs
Thursdays, led by the TA.

For each lab, you must attend in person (we will take attendance if this becomes an issue), and then turn in the required documents to Canvas by midnight on the day of the lab. This counts for 15% of your grade.  Scoring per lab is done on a pass/fail basis.  We will automatically give all students one "free" lab that you do not need to turn in -- you do not need to tell us which lab, we automatically remove one of your lowest scores.

## Exams
- There will be **no exams**
- There is no **final** exam 

## Projects

There are no projects (some semesters we do a final project instead of a final exam)

## Homeworks

There will be weekly homeworks.  You are allowed to drop all homework (this will be done automatically).

## Grading
- 15% for lab/recitation days. 
  - Each day is pass/fail (you turn it in on time or you don't), but you are allowed one free "droppped" lab
- 30% Homework.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed one free "dropped" homework. Your lowest-scoring homework will be automatically dropped.
- 30% Midterms (2 midterms, each 15%)
- 25% Final exam

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate, but note that there is no set "quota" of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly competing with your classmates.

## Course website

We will use github for public content (notes, demos, syllabus), and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for private content like grades and homework solutions. 
- We have some prerecorded videos on **youtube** from a Covid semester; these are unlisted, but we can email you the links if you have to miss class
- We'll use **gradescope** for grading (this integrates automatically with Canvas)
- We can use **piazza** for Q&A forums if there is student desire

## Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead, you can use your one dropped homework.  Under exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, including COVID-19, or serious family issues), homework can be turned in late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:
- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped homework. This is foreseeable, and not an "emergency", so it does not count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes infected with COVID-19 and you have to return to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss arrangements.

Similarly, **missing exams** are not made up except under the same exceptional circumstances.

If you miss the **final exam** for a legitimate reason, then it may be an option to get an "Incomplete" grade for the course and retake the final exam in a different semester. Otherwise, you need to take the final exam.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does not make sense.  Cheating does not hurt the instructor, it hurts the student (and hurts the grades of honest classmates).

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

"Minor infractions" include not following the instructions during an exam (in person or remote). For example, if the instructions on a remote test are to keep your microphone on and your hands in sight of your webcam, then failing to follow these instructions construes a minor infraction, and (even though cheating may not be proven) you are subject to losing points.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.  Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet, but you may never post for help on online forums.  (Regarding forums, please use our Piazza website if you want a Q&A forum).

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that students will continue to act appropriately.

## Acceptable use of AI in this class

Students are allowed to:

- use "autocomplete" style coding assistance, like Copilot.  (*Why? because this is now as ubiquitious as spell-check, and it has become part of how people program.*) However, we strongly suggest you to use it sparingly, and to double-check!

- use LLMs to ask for documentation, but not with an AI that has access to your code. For example, you can google documentation and use the "AI generated summaries" provided by Google, but you cannot use Github copilot integrated with VS Code, or gemini integraded with colab (nor any context-aware chatbot).

- we **discourage** AI use whenever possible -- you don't need practice with it (it's easy!), and college is the time to practice your non-AI skills

- Tools like wolfram Alpha, Desmos, etc., are allowed unless explicitly disallowed for a particular problem, but we discourage their use. They will **not** be allowed on the midterms, so please do not get reliant on them.

Students are **not allowed** to:

- explicitly asking a LLM, like ChatGPT/Claude..., to do **solve** anything for you. This covers both code and math.
  - For example, putting in the text of a homework problem and asking a LLM to generate the solution (or code) is not allowed.

#### Enforcement
For any major assignment (homework, or take-home exam if relevant), the instructor reserves the right to randomly check students, and/or check students with suspicious work.  If a student is checked, they will need to do a live session with the instructor (either live-coding if it is coding related, or a whiteboard session if it is math related) so that the instructor can ask the student questions or give them tasks.

#### Consequences of violating policy

- First-time minor violations of the AI policy will result in losing points on the specific problem; the amount of points lost is up to instructor discretion, depending on the severity of the infraction

- Major violations, or repeat violations, will result in a 0 on the entire relevant assignment

- Egregious and/or repeated major violations will result in failing the class


## Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any course. After 11:59 PM Sept. 5 2025, dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be billed for tuition. 

# Generic policies

## HONOR CODE
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/students/honor-code-and-student-code-conduct). Violations of the Honor Code may include but are not limited to: plagiarism (including use of paper writing services or technology [such as essay bots]), cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. Understanding the course's syllabus is a vital part of adhering to the Honor Code.

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution: StudentConduct@colorado.edu. Students found responsible for violating the Honor Code will be assigned resolution outcomes from Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution and will be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member. Visit [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/students/honor-code-and-student-code-conduct) for more information on the academic integrity policy. 

## ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES, TEMPORARY MEDICAL CONDITIONS, AND MEDICAL ISOLATION
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or <dsinfo@colorado.edu> for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.

If you have a temporary illness, injury or required medical isolation for which you require adjustment, let the instructor know in writing as soon as possible. The nature of the illness does not have to be disclosed, and a "doctor's note" is not required. For most common temporary illnesses, it is the student's responsibility to make up the work.

## ACCOMMODATION FOR RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.
In this class, if you must miss the final exam due to religious reasons, talk to the instructor at the **beginning of the semester** to make special arrangements. If the homework is due on the date of a religious holiday, you are expected to turn the homework in **early**. If you have a religious holiday that lasts longer than one week, and so therefore you would not receive the homework with enough time to turn it in early, talk to the instructor at the beginning of the semester. For participation grades, talk to the instructor the **week before** the holiday.

## PREFERRED STUDENT NAMES AND PRONOUNS
CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information does not always align with how they identify. If you wish to have your preferred name (rather than your legal name) and/or your preferred pronouns appear on your instructors’ class rosters and in Canvas, visit the [Registrar's website](https://www.colorado.edu/registrar/students/records/info/preferred) for instructions on how to change your personal information in university systems.

## CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR
Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, marital status, political affiliation, or political philosophy.
